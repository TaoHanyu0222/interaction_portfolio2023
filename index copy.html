               Vernacular Web by Olia Lialina
                  
                  
         <p>If i saw this kind of website a few years ago I would be confused at the choice of the layout, font choice and the decision to organize a website as such, but now I found it immediately as aesthetic and pleasing to the eye. This article proved my point exactly. Websites have evolved over the years, from its humble beginnings to itĄŊs now monstrous form of the World Wide Web as we know it today. The point is, this type of media progresses and moves forward, viewing back at itĄŊs past works and deeming it as a ĄŪnegative exampleĄŊ as Lialina puts it. When the personal sites and authentic sites became less popular it was not discarded but forgotten, as the wed advanced it left the older stylistic choice slip past. However as the article compares the progression of web design to fashion, the past trends always seem to find itĄŊs way back to the front lines.

          My website is a shifting house next to a<br> river of knowledge. What could yours be?<br> by Laurel Schwulst        <p>
         

          Interaction is a huge part of an efficient website, aesthetics of course play a large role in terms of composition, imagery, text and effects; however interaction is what creates communication between a user and the platform like Laurel explicitly highlights. Successfully developing a web includes factoring in all of these aspects, even though its virtual animation and methods of creating transitional effects that attracts the audience and the cursor being another element that can keep one engaged. Sometimes websites are transitioning; they are mobile in a way where movement allows one to explore further. Schwulst stresses on the importance of having your own website as compared to owning an individual website as a plant, shelf, plant, garden and puddle etc. The metaphor of a puddle he uses is quite apt in my opinion as he claims that though the life of a website can be finite and determined its in one's own hands to close it whenever.

          Typography and the Screen by Loretta Staples
     <p>
      This reading discusses the relevance of technological development on digital typography during the 1980s and 90s. The paper focuses on the Macintosh platform and the improvement of its user experience throughout the years. New Tools that are introduced recently such as the Apple computers and its associated softwares allowed designers to digital content like never before. The popularization of cyberspace also allowed the design community to communicate and share the newest innovations of digital typography.

          The Web’s Grain by Frank Chimero
         <p>
         
          This reading was initially quite grim because of how it carries you through, the excitement that was felt for the birth of the internet to the inevitable fall or loss of awe as he describes it. This quote I felt was perfect to follow that statement “ “We begin in admiration and end by organizing our disappointment.” I think him discussing the Buddhist practice of looking at everything from a beginner's point of view was interesting. The overcomplication of the web has made some of the things being designed almost inaccessible or “uncomfortable” for the platforms they were designed for, a great example he used was the apple website. I think a lot of what he said was valid but I am interested to see what he thinks a useful example of web design is, because the average person may view his example of the apple website as good.

          Black Gooey Universe by American Artist
 <p>This reading was incredibly abstract but I think the goal was to use technology as a vehicle to discuss racial discrimination within the tech world and the limitations of having these insular white cis male spaces can create within in tech. The insular-ness that silicon valley has as it produces these white tech bros decade after decade that are increasingly out of touch with the consumer/ user base. There is so much about technology and its ways of being developed and why it was developed that are rooted in anti-blackness, but this reading has tackled the issues of diversity and racism in tech in a way that I think is fantastic.

          Function as Narrative by Weiyi Li
         <p>
         
          In this article, Li argues that in the field of design, the function of a product or object is not simply a functional aspect, but also serves as a narrative element. Li supports this argument by examining several case studies and providing examples of products and objects that not only fulfill their practical purposes but also convey a meaningful story.<br>Li's perspective challenges the conventional view of design as purely utilitarian and highlights the importance of storytelling in design. The idea that the function of an object can be used as a narrative device adds another layer of depth and meaning to design that I had not previously considered.<br> One example that particularly stood out to me was the design of the clock in the film "Back to the Future." The clock not only served as a functional timepiece but also played a crucial role in the narrative, emphasizing the importance of time and punctuality in the film. This example exemplifies Li's argument that the function of an object can enhance the storytelling aspect of a design.

          Can the Internet be archived? by Jill Lepore

         <p>
         
          Opposing the last article, I agree more with what this article states and talks about. We always hear the saying of how once something is on the internet, it's there forever. But how accessible is it? Many people post and interact with the web, it is so easy to cover a day's worth of content put out in just under an hour. You’ve got sources with the same tag, same name, sometimes same dates that certain things are harder to find than others. I find that relevancy is important as deleted instagram pictures with more interactions are easier to find than ones that were deleted at just 12 likes. Someone here mentioned the way back machine. I think that is a cool site that archives and tracks certain pages and how they once looked, its a cool showcase of our evolution and this is probably the most convenient and accessible way for me to check back at older posts and such.

          "Data Feminism / Collect, Analyze, Imagine, Teach"<br> by Catherine D'Ignazio & Lauren Klein
         <p>
         
          In this article the author discussed the problem of injustice in the field of data science. The oppressed minority group, often people of color or female, are the ones whose rights are taken away by the people in power. So how do we solve this problem? The author introduced a solution through examining power and challenging power. We need to firstly let the people in power be aware of the ongoing inequity that happens in all aspects of the society. Then, we would be able to take action with the help of the people in power, thus solving the problem. It was such a hard time reading the article because it reveals the truth that these problems that some people were born to face might never be known by people who have the power. I felt sad when reading about the black children killed in the neighborhood. And although the author provides us a way to address the problem, there’s still a long way to go.

          "Sharing as Survival: Mindy Seu on the Cyberfeminism Index" <br>by Marie Hoejlund & Mindy Seu
         <p>
          In this reading, a project called Cyberfeminism Index from Mindy Seu is discussed in many different perspectives including the inspiration of creating, the interface, and the interaction with the user. It is really fascinating that this website is providing tons of information and it is not complete but is continuously developed through invitation to edit. I really like the “default” interface of it because it looks really simple and easy to navigate for the users especially for processing and searching in so many different resources. Also, it is surprising that when the users try to interact with the website, it shows its simple, beautiful interactive elements. That is something I want to use in my own projects.

          This reading was interesting in the way it talks about the problematic nature of the digital sphere, more specifically, how queer and people of colour are often disregarded in terms of the forward thinkers of cyberculture. Legacy Russell expresses the need for more representation of people of color and queer people within this space, and hopes for feministic values  to apply itself into this field as well. Essentially, Legacy Russell wants people to think outside the normalized space of white, cisgendered, straight people in this space, and to focus their attention onto the minority and

      <div class="project">“The Hidden Life of an Amazon User” by Joana Moll
        <p>
      
          While short I felt that this reading opened us (consumers, designers, etc) up to have another conversation about technology and how detrimental it can be to us. Since the birth of hyper-personalized technology, we as consumers have been taught to believe that there is only benefit in this level of personalization. But rarely are we the benefactors of the results yielded from that type of tech. It's more commonly understood now that all of that personalization is involuntarily given up for the monetary gain of the companies that offer us the illusion of personalized convenience. This is something companies can no longer hide behind and thus we have entered an era of unabashed surveillance. And us (consumers, designers, etc) having found our “peace” with it can look toward the other impacts of this reckless surveillance. Joana Moll depicts very clearly the negative aspects of these concepts through the tech behind these so-called “business strategies” and their impacts not only on the consumer but the environment. While I am entirely unsurprised, it was uncomfortably eye-opening to see how much goes into Amazon’s surveillance and how that translates to its environmental impact.

        <p>
          In the article, a study is presented that examines the depletion of Earth's finite resources in the face of human activities' exponential growth, projecting a potential global resource depletion within a few decades of the 21st century if immediate action is not taken. The suggested solutions include reducing birth rates and focusing on agriculture. Furthermore, the article highlights the significant energy consumption of the internet, accounting for approximately 10% of global electricity production, with this rate expected to rise. A solution called Low Tech is introduced as a means to address this issue, exemplifying how websites can minimize unnecessary data and serve smaller communities with shared interests. This approach involves avoiding mainstream internet providers and instead utilizing independent mesh networks or hosting content on local computers through a peer-to-peer web.

        <p>
          This reading was very interesting in the way that it talks about the philosophy and process on how to run a successful social media site. Additionally, not only does it provide information on both the benefits and negatives of choosing to run a social media site, but also talks about user retention and how to optimize user experience in a small social media site. Moreover, this reading was interesting with how it compares what you can do in a small social media site versus a large one such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. Overall, I found this article to be intriguing since it provides a step by step process on how to actually make your own social media site such as linking programs, and talks about the technicalities that go along with it.

      <div class="project">“The Coup We Are Not Talking About” by Shoshana Zuboff
<p>The article "The Coup We Are Not Talking About" by Shoshana Zuboff raises important concerns about the rise of surveillance capitalism and its impact on democracy. The author argues that the collection and use of personal data by tech companies have created a new form of power that is opaque, unaccountable, and largely unchecked by democratic institutions. This new power poses a threat not only to individual privacy but also to the collective values of democracy.
  Zuboff traces the historical development of surveillance capitalism and explains how it has enabled tech companies to amass vast amounts of personal data and to create new business models that make money from this data. She argues that this has given tech companies a new form of power that is at odds with democratic values and that has the potential to undermine the ability of individuals and communities to control their own lives.
  Personally speaking, In recent years, China has seen a rapid expansion of surveillance technologies and the use of personal data by both private and state actors. This has raised concerns about privacy, free expression, and human rights.
  The concerns raised by Shoshana Zuboff's article are particularly relevant in the Chinese context, since china haseits  unique political and technological landscape. The rise of surveillance capitalism, combined with the government's increasing use of technology for social control, has led to a situation where the power of private corporations and the state are increasingly intertwined.
