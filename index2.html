 <p>Assigned as a mini-project, we were asked to answer a series of questions from our Interaction Lecture professor. 
     In addition to answering these questions, we were asked to code a website which reflects our answers. 
     The creative direction was left open-ended with only a select few requests from our professor. 
     I chose a simple, clean cut design to focus the attention on the questionnaire itself. 
     I focused on type hierarchy as it relates to the flow of the commentary.
